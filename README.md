# Social bonding or credible signaling?

A [2021 issue of Behavioral and Brain Sciences](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/volume/754CEA3F64D634A7B205A922E359BA7C) contains two target articles discussing the origins of musicality. [Sam Mehr and colleagues](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/origins-of-music-in-credible-signaling/82D36C04DA04D96AD9A77EEAF4BBFB34) argue that musicality originates in credible signaling, while [Pat Savage and colleagues](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/music-as-a-coevolved-system-for-social-bonding/F1ACB3586FD3DD5965E56021F506BC4F) instead point to social bonding.

We asked the many commentators where they would position themselves in this debate, and visualized the result at
